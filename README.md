<!-- Pseudocode

1. Define rows and columns properly using the Grid system from bootstrap. Add to HTML
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row my-row">
          <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-xl-6 "></div>
      </div>



2. Add Bootstrap code to Style sheet to make The webpage responsive...I believe it would look something ike this
    / Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
    // No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap

    // Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
    @media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

    // Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
    @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

    // Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
    @media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

    // Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
    @media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
    
3. I believe I have made the img responsive by using bootstrap but am not sure if it works/code is in the correct spot.
